## üîß Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Used

**Approve Notice:**

```typescript

POST/api/notices/:id/approve

```

- Admin only
- Sets `isApproved: true`
- Returns success response

**Fetch Notices:**

```typescript

GET/api/notices?limit=100

```

- Filters based on user role
- Staff see own + approved
- Students see only approved
- Admins see all

### Frontend Logic

**Permission Checks:**

```typescript

const canApprove = user?.role ==='admin'&&!notice.isApproved

```

**State Management:**

```typescript

const[pendingNotices, setPendingNotices]= useState<NoticeWithAuthor[]>([])

const[pendingCount, setPendingCount]= useState(0)

```

**Approval Handler:**

```typescript

const handleApprove =async(noticeId:string)=>{

  const response =await fetch(`/api/notices/${noticeId}/approve`,{

    method:'POST',

    credentials:'include',

  })

  

  if(response.ok){

    // Remove from pending list (optimistic update)

    setPendingNotices(pendingNotices.filter(item => item.notice.id !== noticeId))

  }

}

```
